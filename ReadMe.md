## BlumenOS
BlumenOS is a little kernel system that i write in C/ASM to have fun and learn about os dev.

## I am a begginer
I am not a good prorammer, so, my os will probably never be safety and usable.

## GNU grub source code 
the bootloader that i use, GNU grub, is licensed under the GNU gpl that requires that i publish the source code corresponding to the software (here, GNU grub 2.02), so, i have put a file, grub-2.02.tar.gz that containing the source code GNU Grub

## NOW :
 Actually, the OS read char from the serial port and print them in the frame buffer.
 Active the Detach tab and select the serial0 screen, or add the -serial stdio in the run command line.
